    Question: "What is a hackathon?",

    Question: "I’m not a programmer! Can I still attend?",
    Answer:
      "Absolutely! Hackathons aren't only for programmers! Students from other disciplines are just as important as programmers when it comes to creating a well-rounded project. If you are a passionate learner looking to build something amazing, we invite you to hack with us!"

    Question: "What should I bring with me?",

    Question: "Do I need a team to participate?",
    Answer:
      "You can hack alone or as a team of up to four students! No team? No problem! If you are looking for some teammates, feel free to reach out to other participants to see if they need some teammates as well. There will also be a team building event before hacking starts, in case you can’t find a team before then!"

    Question: "How much does it cost?",
    Answer:
